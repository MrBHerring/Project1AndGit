# Project1AndGit

Project1 is a project that demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and visualizes vaccination data using a package called 'ggplot2'.
With Git, version control has been used to push changes from a local version of this project. This is useful for maintaining updates on this project offline or online.
As a result, data can be pushed into separate folders to make this project easier to understand. Project1AndGit displays the data and code necessary to construct a report on the project's findings.

# Project Goals

-Explore the data by analyzing the us_contagious_diseases dataset.
-Visualize the dataset to understand how the week_reporting variable is affected by different states, years, and diseases.
-Calculate the disease rates and find how adjusted weekly reports affect disease rates.
-Use scatterplots to find differences between unadjusted and adjusted rates from population diseases.
-Implement boxplots to analyze specific diseases within specific states.
-Find the overall rates for an entire country and a specific state and use line plots to visualize the diseases present.
-Finally, explain the findings within this project and discuss how adjusted weekly reports affect calculating rates per population for diseases.

# Reasons for project implementation

To learn how to analyze, visualize, and interpret data; which are critical skills for a data scientist to learn.
To understand how analyzing vaccination data is a real-world problem; in this case, this problem raises awareness of how impactful diseases can be along with their spreading within different regions over time.
