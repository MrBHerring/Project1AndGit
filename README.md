# Project1AndGit

Project1 is a project that demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and visualizes vaccination data using a package called 'ggplot2'.

The goals of this project are as follows:

-Explore the data by analyzing the us_contagious_diseases dataset.
-Visualize the dataset to understand how the week_reporting variable is affected by different states, years, and diseases.
-Calculate the disease rates and find how adjusted weekly reports affect disease rates.
-Use scatterplots to find differences between unadjusted and adjusted rates from population diseases.
-Implement boxplots to analyze specific diseases within specific states.
-Find the overall rates for an entire country and a specific state and use line plots to visualize the diseases present.
-Finally, explain the findings within this project and discuss how adjusted weekly reports affect calculating rates per population for diseases.

Motivation?:
To become a data scientist, one must learn the basics. Learning how to analyze, visualize, and interpret data are critical set of skills for a data scientist to learn.
Furthermore, analyzing vaccination data is a real-world problem that is relevant to raising awareness of how impactful diseases can be along with their spreading within different regions over time.
